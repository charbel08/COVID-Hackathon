# COVID-Hackathon

The objective of the hackathon was to use ML to predict the number of confirmed COVID cases in the U.S.

We needed to find a dataset and figure out an ML algorithm to perform the task, the team opted for Recurrent Neural Nets

We ended up using the John Hopkins dataset to train our model
